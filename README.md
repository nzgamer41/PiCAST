Just so you're aware, this version of PiCast has been modified to run on regular desktop Linux machines rather then just on a Raspberry Pi, since I don't want to have to give up my main monitor just for a Pi, and I have no spare HDMI monitors. The core nodejs script is exactly the same as the original, it's just the setup.sh that's different.
